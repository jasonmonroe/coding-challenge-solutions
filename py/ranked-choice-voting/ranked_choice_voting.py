| Overview:  Voters approved a revamp of the election season where no longer
| is it who gets the most votes wins the election but now a rank-choice voting
| system that takes into account overall voter sentiment.
|
| This system allows voters to rank their choices in order of preference. If
| a candidate receives more than half of the first choice votes, they win.
|
| This is a script to run multiple elections to determine a winner by a ranked
| choice.
| The systems are: Point Score, Remaining Candidates, Next Choice, Redistribution,
| Voted-Weighted Systems
